    <h2>Remote Service Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      Starting a support plan creates an account for tracking and processing
      support requests. This plan eliminates the need to process individual
      purchase orders for minor modifications, troubleshooting, and technical
      support. The result is improved efficiency for both organizations and the
      ability to quickly and efficiently handle these types of requests. Best of
      all, you will have the confidence of knowing that our remote service will
      be performed by the same team of skilled and experienced Gyptech engineers
      that install and comission equipment.

    description="Depending on the need, your control system can be accessed in cooperation with your existing corporate VPN controls, a Gyptech supplied hardware-based VPN device or through the use of a shared desktop platform such as LogMeIn. Whichever solution you choose your security is one of our top priorities. We are dedicated to providing solutions that provide high levels of data security. We can also design systems with hardwired switches, meaning you are always in control of when your system is accesses."
